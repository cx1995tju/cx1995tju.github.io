Duke Jing of Qi was traveling near the Shaohai when a messenger on horseback arrived to report, "Ying is gravely ill and is near death. He fears Your Grace will be late." Duke Jing immediately rose in alarm, but before long, another messenger arrived. The Duke ordered, "Prepare the carriage quickly! Let groom HanShu drive it."

After traveling a few hundred steps, the Duke felt the driver was not fast enough, so he seized the reins and took over himself. After another few hundred steps, he found the horses were not moving quickly enough, so he abandoned the carriage entirely and ran on foot.
